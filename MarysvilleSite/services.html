								A dental implant is an ideal tooth restoration for people who are missing one or more teeth as
								a result of injury, periodontal disease, or any other reason. A dental implant is a metal post
								that is surgically positions into the jaw. Once in place and bone surrounding the implant has
								had time to heal, a replacement tooth is attached to the post. While implants are typically
								more expensive than other methods of tooth replacement, they provide superior benefits.
								Implants are stronger than natural teeth and generally last 10-20 years. They are also a more
								favorable approach than bridgework since they do not depending on neighboring teeth for
								support.
								To receive implants, you need to have healthy gums and adequate bone to support the
								implant. You must also be committed to excellent oral hygiene and regular dental visits as
								these are critical to the long-term success of dental implants.

								Maintaining good dental hygiene is one of the most important things you can do for your teeth
								and gums. Healthy teeth not only enable you to look and feel good, they make it possible to eat
								and speak properly. Good oral health is important to your overall well-being. Daily preventive
								care, including proper brushing and flossing, will help stop problems before they develop.
								In between regular visits to the dentist, there are simple steps that each of us can take to
								greatly decrease the risk of developing tooth decay, gum disease and other dental problems.
								These include:<br>
								● Brush thoroughly twice a day and floss daily<br>
								● Eat a balanced diet and limit snacks between meals<br>
								● Use dental products which contain fluoride, including toothpaste<br>
								● Rinse with a fluoride mouth rinse if advised to do so<br>
								● Make sure children under 12 drink fluoridated water or take a fluoride supplement if
								they live in an on-fluoridated area<br>
								● Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exams<br>
								● Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months<br>
								The following are indications of good oral hygiene:<br>
								● Your teeth are clean and free of debris<br>
								● Gums are pink and do not hurt or bleed when you brush or floss<br>
								● Bad breath is not a constant problem<br>

								Crowns and bridges are used to restore and enhance teeth that are damaged or to take the
								place of missing teeth.
								Crowns<br>
								A crown (also referred to as a cap) is used to entirely cover a damaged tooth. A crown not only
								strengthens a tooth, but it can dramatically improve a tooth’s appearance, shape and
								alignment. Crowns may be used to:<br>
								● Replace a large filling when there is little tooth structure remaining
								● Protect a weak tooth from fracturing
								● Restore a fractured tooth
								● Attach a bridge
								● Cover a dental implant
								● Cover a discolored or poorly shaped tooth
								● Cover a tooth that has had root canal treatment
								Bridges
								A bridge is an ideal method to fill the space created by missing teeth. A bridge is one or more
								artificial teeth cemented into place using the teeth on either side for support. This is an
								option for filling the space created by a missing tooth. Bridge work is as much an art as it is
								an exact science since it replaces a missing tooth both functionally and cosmetically. The
								materials used may be gold alloys, porcelain bonded to metal alloy, or all ceramic material
								made to match your natural tooth color. The choice of material depends on requirements for
								strength, wear, and aesthetics.
								It is important that a missing tooth be replaced as soon as possible. If not treated, the teeth
								surrounding the gap begin to shift inward. Since teeth use their neighbors for support, if one
								is missing they begin to “fall” and shift into the open spaces. This may worsen the bite
								because of the changes in pressure and can eventually result in problems with the jaw such as
								TMJ.
								Bridges and crowns are made by first taking an impression of your mouth. The impression is
								sent to a dental lab where your crown or bridge will be custom made to fit your mouth and
								match your natural tooth color. A temporary crown or bridge will be placed into your mouth
								until your permanent crown or bridge is ready and cemented into place.
								Bridges and crowns are very durable and can last a lifetime with extra care and good oral
								hygiene.

								<h5>Bonding</h5>
								Bonding involves adhering composite resin material that is matched to the color of the tooth,
								to the front of the tooth. This is performed to repair damage caused by decay, to alter the
								alignment of the tooth, close gaps between the teeth, or for other cosmetic purposes.
								First the surface of the tooth is roughened in order to accept the bonding. A gel is applied so
								the resin will adhere to the surface of the tooth. The composite is then placed on the tooth
								and the bonding agent hardens with intense light. The last step is shaping and polishing to
								give a lustrous finish.<br><br>
								<h5>Fillings</h5>
								A filling is a way to restore a tooth damaged by decay back to its normal function and shape.
								If you have a tooth that requires a filling, the dentist will first remove the decayed tooth
								material, clean the affected area, and then fill the cleaned out cavity with a filling material. A
								filling helps prevent further decay by closing off any cracks or spaces where bacteria can
								enter.
								There are a variety of filling materials available including gold, silver, plastic and porcelain.
								The dentist will work with you to determine which material is best, depending on the extent
								of repair, where in the filling is needed, and cost. Each filling material is briefly explained
								below:<br>
								● Amalgam (silver) fillings are a more inexpensive choice and are tolerant to wear.
								However, due to their dark color they are more noticeable than porcelain or composite
								restorations and are not recommended for fillings in very visible areas such as front
								teeth.<br>
								● Composite (plastic) resins are custom made to the exact color of your natural teeth,
								creating a more natural appearance. While white fillings may be less noticeable than
								other materials, they are durable but may not be ideal for large fillings as they may
								chip or wear over time. They can also become stained from coffee, tea or tobacco.<br>
								● Porcelain fillings are called inlays or onlays and are custom created in a lab and then
								bonded to the tooth. They can be matched to the color of the tooth, resist staining, and
								are about the same cost as gold fillings. A porcelain restoration generally covers most
								of the tooth, making the filling nearly undetectable.<br>
								If decay or a fracture has damaged a large portion of the tooth, a crown (or “cap”) may be
								recommended. Decay that has reached the nerve may be treated through root canal therapy or
								through a procedure called pulp capping.

								Root canal treatment (also referred to as root canal therapy or endodontic therapy) is made
								necessary when an untreated cavity reaches all the way to this pulp. Treatment may also be
								needed when deep restorations or trauma to a tooth cause nerve damage. Once the pulp
								becomes infected, and can begin to eat away at the surrounding bone (this is known as an
								abscess). If the pulp is infected, not only is it painful but it will require treatment as it cannot
								heal on its own. Symptoms that indicate the pulp has become infected may include sensitivity
								to hot/cold or sweets, pain, swelling, pain to biting or pressure, and a bad taste in the mouth.
								However, sometimes no symptoms are apparent and you may be unaware of any problem
								until a checkup.<br>
								A root canal is performed to clean out the infected tooth pulp and disinfect the canals of the
								tooth. Alternate treatment would be to extract the tooth. Once the infection is resolved, the
								canal is filled in to prevent any further infection. Usually a core build-up and crown is
								recommended for restoring a tooth that has undergone root canal therapy.

								The gums, ligaments, and bone around the teeth form the foundation for teeth. All structures
								are also referred to as the periodontium. When the periodontium is not healthy, it
								jeopardizes the teeth just as a bad foundation would threaten the stability of a house. Signs of
								unhealthy periodontium include: gums that are red and bleed easily, persistent bad breath,
								gums that are pulled away from the tooth, loose teeth, and changes in the position or bite of
								the teeth. With proper gum treatments, it may be possible to return gum tissue to a healthy
								state.<br>
								If you’re having a problem, come in and see us so we may treat it right away. The treatment
								usually involves a deep cleaning or root planing done under a local anesthetic, along with
								local antibiotic agents. It is important to have gum problems checked promptly, as gum
								disease left alone may eventually need treatment through surgery or extraction.

								Orthodontics is the art of using appliances to straighten and align teeth. Most commonly it
								involves the use of braces to move teeth into proper positing. In this method, brackets are
								bonded to the teeth and arch wires are threaded through the brackets. The arch wires act as a
								track, guiding each tooth to its proper position. There are several types of orthodontic braces
								available to patients, including traditional metal braces, ceramic “tooth colored” braces, as
								well as clear plastic braces.<br>
								Ceramic “Tooth Colored” Brackets — Ceramic braces are translucent brackets that blend in
								with your natural tooth color. They are used with patients who are concerned about the
								appearance of their smile as they are less metallic looking than traditional braces. Ceramic
								braces are designed to resist staining and discoloration over long periods of time.<br>
								Metal Braces — Metal Braces are the most economical and traditionally used braces. Metal
								braces are also ideal for those with more extensive realignment needed.

								Orthodontic Retainers are appliances made from plastic and stainless steel to custom fit your
								mouth. They act as a guide to hold your teeth into place after braces are removed. The
								retainer holds your teeth in place so your surrounding gums and bone can adjust around
								them – allowing you to maintain your realigned smile. Although the time you must wear a
								retainer will vary, many orthodontists recommend retainers are worn into the early 20s until
								the bone in your jaw and mouth has stopped growing.<br>

								A denture is a removable replacement for missing teeth and surrounding tissues. There are
								two types of dentures available, including partial and complete dentures. Partial dentures are
								used when some natural teeth remain, while complete dentures are used to completely
								replace all teeth. Dentures are made to resemble your natural teeth so there should be no
								noticeable change to your appearance. In fact, dentures may even improve your smile!
								This restoration method is used to restore your smile and mouth function if all your teeth
								have been lost. The dentures are custom created to resemble natural teeth and are positioned
								to take the place of natural teeth. Complete dentures are removable and may require
								adjustments in order to create a proper fit with the gums and mouth.<br>
								A removable partial denture is a device used when one or more natural teeth still remain in
								the upper or lower jaw. They usually consist of replacement teeth attached go a gum-colored
								plastic base which is held in place in the mouth. A fixed partial denture acts the same as a
								removable denture, but it is cemented into place using adjacent teeth for support.
								New dentures may feel awkward or loose for the first few weeks until the muscles of your
								cheek and tongue learn to keep them in place and you are comfortable eating and speaking.
								Although this may require some practice you will adjust and enjoy the benefits a full mouth of
								teeth can provide.<br>

								characteristics that give the overall appearance. Any of these can be enhanced to provide a
								stunning new smile.<br>

								Wisdom teeth are the last molars or “third molars” that develop on each side of the jaws.
								Wisdom teeth usually emerge in the back of the mouth between the ages of 16-20.
								Wisdom teeth are a valuable asset to the mouth when they are healthy and properly
								positioned. Often, however, problems develop that require their removal. When the jaw isn’t
								large enough to accommodate wisdom teeth, they can become impacted (unable to come in
								or misaligned). Wisdom teeth may also grow in sideways, emerge only part way through the
								gum or remain trapped beneath the gum and bone.<br>
								A wisdom tooth extraction is a relatively routine procedure. The dentist will numb the area in
								your mouth with a local anesthesia. Oral medication may also be given to help relax you since
								we do not use IV sedation.<br>
								After the tooth is removed, we will provide care instructions to ensure proper healing. Some
								pain and swelling may occur but will normally subside after a few days. You should call your
								dentist if you have prolonged or severe pain, swelling, bleeding or fever.

								Good oral hygiene should always be practiced because the loss of a single tooth can have
								major impact upon your oral health and appearance. Although dentists will use every
								measure to prevent tooth loss, there are still occasions when a tooth may need to be
								extracted. A tooth may need to be extracted for the following reasons:<br>
								● Severe decay<br>
								● Advanced periodontal disease<br>
								● Infection or abscess<br>
								● Orthodontic correction<br>
								● Malposition teeth<br>
								● Fractured teeth or roots<br>
								● Impacted teeth<br>
								After careful examination and treatment, the dentist may advise to have a tooth extracted.
								Before a tooth is removed, the dentist will take an x-ray in order to understand the shape and
								position of the tooth and surrounding bone. Based on the degree of difficulty, we may refer
								you to a specialized oral surgeon.<br>
								For a simple extraction, we will first apply a local anesthetic to prevent pain and discomfort.
								The tooth will be loosened with a tool called an elevator and then removed with dental
								forceps. Once the procedure is complete, the area may be closed with one or two stitches. We
								will then provide you with care instructions to alleviate discomfort and ensure proper
								healing.<br>
